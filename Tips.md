# zip():
list(zip(x, y))
# use index to loop a list:
for **i** in **range(len(list))**:
# random numbers:
import numpy
random number = numpy.random.binomial(n= , p=, size=)
# import random:
random.randint(a,b) will return an integer between a and b (inclusive).
So, random.randint(5, 8) could return any integer between 5 and 8 including both 5 and 8.
